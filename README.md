## Instructions About Visualization
By using visualization, it is possible analyze broadcasts through years.<br/>
You can see the density of broadcasts and exact places that are mentioned in these broadcasts.<br/>
You can examine broadcasts related to cantons and each broadcast individually.<br/>

**Important Notes**: Set your browser's zoom level to around %70 to have the best experience! <br/>

## Visualising the TV Mirror
#### Evolution and Importance of the National Swiss Radio/TV Broadcasts

The popular media is an (imperfect) mirror of the society. In this project, we want to study the effect of social trends and events of the past century on TV/Radio broadcasts. The 20th century saw the invention and ubiquity of the broadcast media: first radio and then television. At the same time, many international events (World Wars, the rise and the fall of Communism, the formation of European Union, etc) as well as national incidents (sexual revolution of 1960’s, the establishment of women voting right) took place in this period. All of these events had profound impact on the society, and as a result on broadcast media such as TV and Radio. Having access to a wealth of information about TV/Radio emissions all the way from 1930’s until today, we believe we can track this events and by means of a data story and a convincing visualization, highlight the events of the decades past.

### Motivation
Our main motivation is the sheer amount and scope of the structured data provided by the Swiss public broadcasting organization, RTS. Although the majority of the data is understandably recorded in recent years, it covers an expansive temporal span (from 1900’s until today).

More importantly, given that in March 2017 the Swiss will decide by popular vote whether to abolish the “Billag” (which also supports RTS), such a study is very much relevant and timely. An interactive and easy-to-understand visualization has the potential to showcase the added value of this public organization over the course of the past century.

### Target Audience
Given the last point, our target audience is the general public. Ideally, we want our results to be accessible to the electorate, while being accurate and meaningful for the informed citizen.

### What to Show
We would like to have an interactive map with a timeline (to keep track of evolution of the map through time) that shows the how broadcasts connect different placestogether. In order to emphasise the importance of RTS/SRG/SSR in bringing the Swiss together, we have thought of a map where edges (a field map) connect the areas of interest together. (Note that such visualization is only possible for the records that have more than one “geographical theme” (which is a feature in the dataset) associated with them.)

Also, we are planing to demonstrate with which topics that cantons are connected, by displaying the key words related to the topics for each of the connection. By doing that, we also plan to demonstrate which topics are mentioned in broadcasts through years.
