## Visualising the TV Mirror
#### Evolution and Importance of the National Swiss Radio/TV Broadcasts

The popular media is an (imperfect) mirror of the society. In this project, we want to study the effect of social trends and events of the past century on TV/Radio broadcasts. The 20th century saw the invention and ubiquity of the broadcast media: first radio and then television. At the same time, many international events (World Wars, the rise and the fall of Communism, the formation of European Union, etc) as well as national incidents (sexual revolution of 1960's, the establishment of women voting right) took place in this period. All of these events had profound impact on the society, and as a result on broadcast media such as TV and Radio. Having access to a wealth of information about TV/Radio emissions all the way from 1930's until today, we believe we can track this events and by means of a data story and a convincing visualization, highlight the events of the decades past. To this end, we are going to mainly use the RTS dataset. However, to complement our analyses, we will potentially make use of Spinn3r, other Swiss Open datasets, and Wikimedia data as well.

### Motivation
Our main motivation is the sheer amount and scope of the structured data provided by the Swiss public broadcasting organization, RTS.  Although the majority of the data is understandably recorded in recent years, it covers an expansive temporal span (from 1900’s to this day).

More importantly, given that in March 2017 the Swiss will decide by popular vote whether to abolish the “Billag” (which also supports RTS), such a study is very much relevant and timely. An interactive and easy-to-understand visualization has the potential to showcase the added value of this public organization over the course of the past century.

### Target Audience
Given the last point, our target audience is the general public.  Ideally, we want our results to be accessible to the electorate, while being accurate and meaningful for the informed citizen.

### Related Work
This is an inspiring visualization/data story made for a campaign:

But since have Geographical and Temporal data, something like this would be ideal:

### What to Show
Ideally, we would want most of our charts have an interactive timeline. So that the evolution of each metric be meaningfully visualised.    

Moreover, since we have geographical data, we would like to have an interactive map, also with a timeline, that shows the places of interest in the broadcasts.

In order to emphasise the importance of RTS/SRG/SSR in bringing the Swiss together, we have thought of a similar map, but instead with arrows (a field map) that connect the areas of interest together. (For the records that have  more than one “geographical theme”— this is a feature in the dataset—  associated with them.)

### Note(s)
This visualization is meant to complement this project: [https://github.com/m-yaghini/ada17/tree/master/project-master](https://github.com/m-yaghini/ada17/tree/master/project-master)

## Project Information

- Setup a website on Github pages
- Write the story around the visualization and screencast its presentation in a 2-min video
- Host the code and data on Github with the process book as a PDF file
- Add a README file that explains the technical setup and intented usage

### Screencast
- Demonstrate what to do with the visualization
- Talk about the main contributions rather than on technical details
- 2 min video not more (max +5 sec)

### Process Book
- Overview, motivation, target audience
- Related work and inspiration
- What am I trying to show this?
- Where data come from and what are processing steps?
- What visualization have used to gain insights on the data?
- What are the different visualizations considered?
- Justify the design decisions using the perceptual and design principles
- Describe the intent and functionality of the interactive visualizations
- Provide clear and well-referenced images showing the key design and interaction elements
- What is learned about the data by using the visualizations?
- How the question is answered?
- How well does the visualization work, and how can it be further improved?


### Schedule
- Proposals (via google form) (Week 9)
- Functional project prototype review (Week 11)
- Final project with screencast, story telling and peer-evaluations (Week 13)
- Project presentations (Week 14)

### Grading
